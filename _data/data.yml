        details: |
          - Developing and deploying backend components of a Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) tool based on client requirements, 
          proficiently troubleshooting functionality issues in new/existing features built using Flask, Redis, and MongoDB in a Linux environment.
          - Optimized the sales rate computation algorithm of the VMI tool, decreasing processing time from hours to minutes. 
          - Redesigned MongoDB 
          database and implemented multiprocessing for 8x faster file creation in the forecasting module of the VMI tool.
          - Designed and implemented a CV solution using Hugging Face Transformers and Tesseract OCR to automatically read and filter data in 
          lengthy Garment Tech Packs of varying visual formats and present essential costing information of raw materials 
          in a structured tabular form, reducing manual effort.
          - Designed and deployed a CV solution using PyTorch and Flask to assign 7 descriptive tags to a garment from a single image while 
          ensuring robust performance (0.82 F1 score) across varying image quality, human models, and poses.
