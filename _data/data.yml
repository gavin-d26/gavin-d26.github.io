career-profile:
    title: About
    summary: |
      I'm currently pursuing my MS in Natural Language Processing at UC Santa Cruz. Over the years, I've developed expertise in NLP, computer vision, and predictive modeling, applying these skills to create intelligent systems for document automation and time series forecasting.
      
      In my previous role as an ML Engineer, I worked on a variety of projects that involved automating document data extraction using OCR, creating efficient image search systems, and developing accurate forecasting models. My interest lies in advancing intelligent question-answering systems, improving information retrieval, and creating personalized recommendation engines.
      
      During my undergraduate years, I had the opportunity to publish research on deep learning models applied to healthcare. Today, I'm excited to develop language-powered tools that make technology more intuitive and accessible to everyone.
